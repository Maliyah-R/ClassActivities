// Follow the steps below to create a **while** loop that TOTALS the numbers from 1 to 100

// 1) create a variable to represent the current number
let currentNum = 1;
// 2) create a variable to represent the current total
let total = 0;
// 3) write a while loop that sums the numbers from 1 to 100

while (currentNum <= 100) {
        total = total + currentNum;
    console.log(currentNum)
    currentNum++;
}

// Now using the same variables you created in steps 1 and 2, create a **for** loops that TOTALS the numbers from 1 to 100

// 1) write a for loop that sums the numbers from 1 to 100

for(let i = 1; i >= 10; i++)
